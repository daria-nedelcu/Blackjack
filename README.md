Blackjack

Game of Blackjack in Python


This game was developed as part of an assignment for Rice University's 
course Interactive Programming in Python. Due to it being developed on 
an online platform, it might not run in every Python IDE. Therefore, 
the easiest way to run this program is to access this link[1] and click Run.

This program implements a game of BlackJack. The player has the option to
request a new card or stand. Both hands (player's and dealer's) are 
analyzed and the highest hand under 21 wins the round. If any of the two
go over 21, that player has busted and loses the round. The Deal button
resets the game and deals another hand.
